A simple CLI-tool to organise notes. This is just a prototype, where I try my ideas out for this tool.

It is in _very_ early development stages. 
The application is only tested on Linux.

**Dependencies**

The application uses `fzf` to perform fuzzy searching.
`Neovim` is the editor used to open and edit the contents of notes.

Try the application using `cargo run`
